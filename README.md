This is a JS project

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to enhance your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts while creating a fun interactive application. This game provides a hands-on experience to solidify your grasp of user input, conditionals, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

Main Features:
Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number that the player has to guess.
User Input: Players can input their guesses through an input field.
Feedback Mechanism: The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Score Tracking: Players can see their current score and attempts, adding a competitive edge to the game.
Game Reset: Once the player guesses the number correctly, they can reset the game to play again.

Learning Points in JavaScript:
DOM Manipulation: You'll learn to interact with HTML elements, updating the content based on player interactions.
Event Handling: Understanding how to handle events like button clicks and input changes.
Control Structures: Utilization of conditionals (if/else statements) to evaluate the player's guesses and respond appropriately.
Data Types: Working with numbers, strings, and possibly arrays to keep track of guesses.
Randomization: Learning how to generate random numbers using JavaScript functions.
